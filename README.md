# accessibility
I'm going to start adding accessibility stuff here.

In the meantime, I do tweet and retweet some accessibility stuff on my Twitter: https://twitter.com/_KaylaSween

My DEV Community blog: https://dev.to/kaylasween

I've also written some blog posts in the past regarding building a more accessible website which you can view on Software Unwound: https://softwareunwound.com/author/kayladsween/ or read the markdown files under `blog-posts/a11y-web-page-series/`.
