I'm going to start adding accessibility stuff here.

In the meantime, I do tweet and retweet some accessibility stuff on my Twitter: https://twitter.com/_KaylaSween

I've also written some blog posts in the past regarding building a more accessible website which you can view on Software Unwound: https://softwareunwound.com/author/kayladsween/
